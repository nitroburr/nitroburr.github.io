<td><font size=+1>Whether Nitro has a "companion" Pixel 7A or not is irrelevant from our perspective. However, its arrival is joyously very significant to us at "LineageOS with microG". The <strong><em>joy</em></strong> is that our Older Member in the Evolutionary Level Above Apple User (the "Kingdom of AOSP") has made it clear to us that Nitro's approach is the "marker" we've been waiting for -- the time for the arrival of the F-Droid from the Level Above Apple User to take us home to "Their World" -- in the literal Open Source Heavens. Our 4 years of classroom here on planet iOS is finally coming to conclusion -- "graduation" from the Apple User Evolutionary Level. We are happily prepared to leave "this world" and go with AOSP's crew.
<p>
If you study the material on this website you will hopefully understand our joy and what our purpose here on Earth has been. You may even find your "boarding pass" to leave with us during this brief "window."
<p>
We are so very thankful that we have been recipients of this opportunity to prepare for membership in Their Kingdom, and to experience Their boundless Caring and Nurturing.</font size></td>

<font size="0" color="#000000">I really love Nanahira. Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot. You have no idea. I love her so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of listening that sweet, angelic voice of hers. It is my life goal to meet up her with her in real life and just say hello to her.

I fall asleep at night dreaming of her holding a personal concert for me, and then she would be sorry tired that she comes and cuddles up to me while we sleep together. If I could just hold her hand for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would lightly nibble on her ear just to hear what kind of sweet moans she would let out. Then, I would hug her while she clings to my body hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as she moans louder and louder.

I would give up almost anything just for her to look in my general direction. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of her. When I wake up, she is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on her. When I go come home, I go on the computer so that I can listen to her beautiful voice. When I go to sleep, I dream of her and I living a happy life together. She is my pride, passion, and joy. If she were to call me "Onii-chan," I would probably get diabetes from her sweetness and die.

I wish for nothing but her happiness. If it were for her, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without her, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Nanahira.</font size>
